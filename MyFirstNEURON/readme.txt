About MyFirstNEURON
MyFirstNEURON is a NEURON demo by Arthur Houweling and Terry Sejnowski.
Perform experiments from the book 'Electrophysiology of the Neuron' by John
Huguenard & David McCormick, or design your own one or two cell simulation.

Book Description: 
This manual and disk, available in IBM PC and Macintosh formats, accompanies 
Shepherd's Neurobiology, 3/e. It can be used separately even though it is 
keyed to the textbook. The 17 experiments investigate such areas as the 
resting membrane potential, action potential, voltage clamp, physiological 
properties of nerve cells, and synaptic potentials. The program allows 
students to propagate the action potential, adjust various parameters and 
observe the effects on nerve cell firing. Students will learn about 
equilibrium potentials and the effects of changing ion concentrations, as 
well as passive and active membrane properties. Separate experiments analyze 
sodium ion and potassium ion currents, the voltage dependence of these 
currents, and sleep vs. waking in single neurons. Study questions are provided 
throughout. This ingeniously-designed program will benefit all undergraduate 
students of neuroscience.
